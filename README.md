For this assignment, we used UI-Integration (with JEST) to test a website that registered a user based on valid login credentials and tested a Roman numeral conversion website. For the tests, I used the DOM testing library to simulate interaction with the websites. I tested edge cases- for the Roman numerals, this was basic and complicated conversions. For the user registration, I tested successful registration, and unsuccessful registration based on the valid input requirements.
